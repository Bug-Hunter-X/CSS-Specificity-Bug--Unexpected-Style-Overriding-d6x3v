The CSS specificity can lead to unexpected styling issues.  For instance, consider the following scenario:

```css
/* Style A */
div p {
  color: blue;
}

/* Style B */
div p {
  color: red !important;
}

/* Style C */
div > p {
  color: green;
}
```

Style B has the highest specificity due to the `!important` flag, so it will override Style A and Style C. Style C would override Style A if `!important` wasn't involved.  However, excessively using `!important` can make CSS harder to maintain and debug.
