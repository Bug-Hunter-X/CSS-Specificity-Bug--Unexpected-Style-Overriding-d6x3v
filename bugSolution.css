To solve this problem, we refactor the CSS to prioritize better specificity without relying on `!important`:

```css
/* Style A */
div {
  color: blue;
}

div p {
  color: green;
}

/* Style B (no longer needs !important) */
p {
  color: red;
}
```

This solution improves maintainability and predictability.  By using a more appropriate element selection, we remove the need for `!important`. Style B is more specific because it directly targets the `p` elements, effectively overriding Style A's style for the `p` elements only.  The order of declarations in this version maintains the correct stylistic choices.
